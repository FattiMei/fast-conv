# Wolfram 1D cellular automata

## Requirements
  * the program must be invoked with the seed of the rule
  * the program must be parametric in the number of rows and cells per row displayed

## Features
  * ascii renderer
  * png / jpeg renderer
  * opengl renderer??

## Future
A cell destiny is decided from the 3 cells above, can we expand the program to use 5 cells above or a general number? At this point it would be cool to experiment with a fast feedback cycle.
